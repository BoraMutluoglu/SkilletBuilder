Skillet Use Cases
-----------------

Skillets are built and played to (1) simplify the burden of repeatable tasks and (2) rapidly get to an outcome using
recommended practices from subject matter experts. These goals can be extended over a wide array of use cases:

Deploy

Instead of manually deploying infrastructure, skillets help with automated or semi-automated tasks. Integrating
with Terraform and Ansible, skillets can provide a web UI interface to capture data and run templates and playbooks.

    * instantiate compute resources in the cloud
    * simplify licensing
    * update device software
    * perform NGFW threat and AV content updates
    * install plug-ins

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save time by levering best practice and reference configurations created by subject matter experts.

    * Day One best practice configurations
    * one-click demo and POC setup
    * mobile workforce remote access
    * SecOps recommended reports and custom signatures
    * vertical-specific use cases
    * quick config guides as skillets

Assess
~~~~~~

Gain visibility about system and configuration state.

    * PAN-OS and Panorama configuration validation checks
    * automated Security Lifecycle Review (SLR)
    * query service information such as Prisma Access service info
